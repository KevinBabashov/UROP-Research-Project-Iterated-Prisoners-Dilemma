# UROP-Research-Project-Iterated-Prisoners-Dilemma
Extension of my CSCI 4511W Final Project through the UROP. Added more complex methods to increase efficiency in agents.

These files are an extension of the popular Prisoners' Dilemma in which two agents are offered to cooperate, defect, and with this version abstain. We wanted to determine if Reinforcement Learning in conjunction with TRAVOS trust models would improve the effectiveness (wealth) of these agents. 

Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Upper Confidence Trees (UCT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and 5 variations of the TRAVOS model were implemented to test if they could perform better. 

To run the game playing and tournament, run the GNN file first to instantiate the Neural Network, then you can run either the Tournament_Player.py or GamePlaying.py to show graphs/results.
